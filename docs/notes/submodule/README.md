# TO-DO

The submodule needs to be tested, it needs to be checked if it pulls updates automatically from the allergens plugin repo. I think this "just works" but definitely needs some testing to make sure it is usuable for plugin development. Having to sync and pull the repo every time is not necessarily a problem in it self but can cause issues if not handled properly.

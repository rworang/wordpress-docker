# Errors

## allergens error

These errors are originating from the allergens plugin. It indicates that **the use** of the load_style and load_admin_js functions from `php/functions.php` needs to be checked. The register and enqueue hooks need to be called at the right moment so the functions need to be reformatted or completely reworked and/or the use of these functions needs to be re-evaluated.
